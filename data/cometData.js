    title: "Comet Nuclei",
    description: "The solid, central core of a comet is a fragile mixture of rocky debris, dust, and frozen gases. Often described as 'dirty snowballs,' these nuclei are primitive leftovers from the solar system’s formation.",

    moreInfo : "A comet nucleus is the solid, central part of a comet. It is the “heart” of the comet and is usually small, often only a few kilometers wide. Scientists often call it a “dirty snowball” because it is made of frozen water, gases, dust, and small rocky particles. The ice in a comet nucleus is not just water ice; it can also include frozen carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia. Dust and rock are mixed into the ice, which makes the nucleus dark and not very reflective. The surface is rough, irregular, and sometimes covered with a layer of dust that protects the ice inside. Comet nuclei are very old, often more than four billion years, so studying them can help scientists understand how the solar system began.When a comet moves closer to the sun, the heat causes the ices in the nucleus to turn into gas, a process called sublimation. This gas, along with dust released from the nucleus, forms a glowing cloud around the nucleus called the coma. The sun’s radiation and solar wind push some of this gas and dust away, creating the long, bright tail of the comet. The tail always points away from the sun, no matter which direction the comet is moving. Even though the tail can be millions of kilometers long, the nucleus remains at the center of the comet and is usually hidden inside the coma.Comet nuclei come in many different shapes and sizes. Most of them are irregular and not spherical, meaning they can be lumpy, elongated, or even shaped like a peanut. Their surfaces can have craters, cracks, and pits caused by the release of gas. The composition of comet nuclei varies depending on where the comet came from. Comets that form in the outer solar system, far from the sun, often have more ices, while those that come closer to the sun may lose some of their volatile materials over time.Scientists are very interested in comet nuclei because they contain materials from the early solar system. These materials have not changed much in billions of years. By studying comet nuclei, scientists can learn about the gases, dust, and ices that were present when the planets were forming. Space missions like Rosetta, which visited comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, have allowed scientists to take close-up pictures and even land on the nucleus. This has helped us understand how the ice and dust are distributed, how comets release gas, and what the surface is like.In summary, the comet nucleus is the small, solid center of a comet made of ice, dust, and rock. It is the source of the comet’s coma and tail when it nears the sun. Nuclei are irregular, dark, and very old, making them a window into the early solar system. Studying them helps scientists learn about the origins of comets, planets, and even life on Earth, because some comets may have brought water and organic materials to our planet billions of years ago. Comet nuclei are small but extremely important objects in space."

    title: "The ComaComet 2I/Borisov",
    description: "Hubble took this image on Oct. 12, 2019, when comet 2I/Borisov was about 260 million miles (418 million kilometers) from Earth. The image shows dust concentrated around the nucleus, but the nucleus itself was too small to be seen by Hubble.",

    moreInfo : "The coma of a comet is the bright, glowing cloud of gas and dust that surrounds the comet’s nucleus when it comes near the sun, and it is one of the most visible and important parts of a comet. The nucleus itself is small, solid, and made of ice, dust, and rock, but when sunlight heats the nucleus, the ices sublimate, meaning they turn directly from solid to gas, carrying dust and small particles along with them. This process forms the coma, which can grow to tens or even hundreds of thousands of kilometers wide, far larger than the nucleus, and gives the comet its characteristic fuzzy appearance in the sky. The coma is usually spherical around the nucleus, but the solar wind and radiation pressure push some of the gas and dust away from the sun, forming the comet’s tail. Studying the coma is very important because it reveals the chemical composition of the comet, including water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other gases, as well as dust and tiny rocks, which are all original materials from the early solar system or, in some cases, from outside the solar system. A famous example is Comet 2I/Borisov, the second known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, which was discovered in 2019. Unlike typical comets from within the solar system, 2I/Borisov came from another star system, making its coma extremely interesting to scientists because it offered a direct look at material formed around another star. Observations of its coma showed that it contained water, dust, and carbon compounds similar to those found in comets from our solar system, suggesting that the building blocks of comets may be common in other planetary systems. The coma also helps astronomers study the activity of the comet, such as how much gas and dust is released, the size and density of dust particles, and how the solar radiation affects them. Instruments on telescopes measure the light emitted or reflected by the gases in the coma to identify chemical elements and molecules, while images of the dust provide information about the physical structure of the comet. By examining the coma, scientists can learn not only about the comet itself but also about the conditions of the region where it formed, whether in our solar system or another. Comet 2I/Borisov’s coma, with its gas jets and expanding cloud, gave researchers a rare opportunity to compare interstellar material to familiar solar system comets, enhancing our understanding of planetary formation, the distribution of water and organic molecules in the galaxy, and how comets may deliver materials necessary for life to planets. In short, the coma is the comet’s “face” to the universe, revealing its composition, activity, and origin, and in cases like 2I/Borisov, it allows us to study material that traveled light-years to visit our solar system."

It does not have a visible coma or tail like a comet, but it showed small changes in speed as it moved, suggesting that tiny amounts of gas might have been released from its surface.

Because it came from outside the solar system, studying ‘Oumuamua helps scientists learn about the materials and conditions in other star systems and how objects can travel between stars.

    moreInfo : "Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was a famous comet discovered in 1993 by astronomers Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker and David Levy, and it is best known for its dramatic collision with Jupiter in 1994. Unlike most comets, Shoemaker-Levy 9 had already broken into more than twenty large fragments due to Jupiter’s strong gravity, which stretched and pulled it apart as it passed close to the planet. Each fragment had its own nucleus, and when they hit Jupiter’s atmosphere, they created massive explosions and giant dark scars that were visible even from Earth with telescopes. The impact released enormous energy, millions of times stronger than the largest nuclear bomb, and it showed scientists how powerful planetary gravity can affect comets. Studying Shoemaker-Levy 9 taught astronomers a lot about comet structure, the behavior of comet fragments, and Jupiter’s atmosphere, including its composition, winds, and cloud layers. It also highlighted the potential danger of comets and asteroids colliding with planets, including Earth.
