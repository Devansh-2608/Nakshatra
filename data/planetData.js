    title : "Earth",
    description : "While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.",

    moreInfo : "Earth is the planet where all humans, animals, and plants live. It is round and moves around the sun. About seventy-one percent of Earth is covered with water, like oceans, seas, and rivers. The rest is land, which includes mountains, valleys, forests, and deserts. Earth has an atmosphere, which is a layer of air that protects living things and gives us oxygen to breathe. The planet has day and night because it spins on its axis. Earth also has seasons like summer, winter, spring, and autumn, which happen because of its tilt and movement around the sun. Earth is unique because it has life, water, and the right conditions to support humans and animals. People live in different countries, speak different languages, and build cities and farms on Earth. It is important to take care of Earth by protecting nature, saving water, and keeping the air and land clean. Without Earth, life as we know it would not exist."

    title : "Mars",
    description :"Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun – is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather.",

    moreInfo : "Mars is a planet in our solar system. It is the fourth planet from the sun, after Earth. People often call it the “Red Planet” because it looks red in the sky. The red color comes from the iron in its soil. Mars is smaller than Earth and has a thin atmosphere, mostly made of carbon dioxide. There is no liquid water on the surface, but scientists have found ice at the poles and signs that water may have flowed there long ago. Mars has mountains, valleys, and the largest volcano in the solar system called Olympus Mons. It also has a huge canyon called Valles Marineris. Mars is very cold, and its days are almost the same length as Earth’s days. Scientists are very interested in Mars because they want to know if life ever existed there. Many robots and rovers have been sent to explore the planet. In the future, people hope to visit or even live on Mars."

    description : "Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.",

    moreInfo : "Saturn is a planet in our solar system. It is the sixth planet from the sun. Saturn is famous for its beautiful rings, which are made of ice, rock, and dust. It is a very large planet and is mostly made of gas, so it does not have a solid surface like Earth. Saturn is much bigger than Earth, but it is very light because it is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. The planet has many moons, more than eighty, and some of them, like Titan, are very big. Saturn is far from the sun, so it is very cold there. Its atmosphere has storms and strong winds that move very fast. Saturn spins very quickly, so its days are short, only about ten and a half hours long. Scientists study Saturn to learn more about the solar system and how planets with rings are formed. Even though it is far away, Saturn can be seen from Earth with a telescope."

    title : "Jupiter",
    description : "Jupiter is a world of extremes. It's the largest planet in our solar system – if it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside. It's also the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over from the Sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago. But it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking about 9.9 hours to spin around once on its axis.",
    link : "https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter-facts/",
    moreInfo : "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. It is the fifth planet from the sun. Jupiter is a gas giant, which means it is mostly made of gas and does not have a solid surface like Earth. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium, and it has many colorful clouds that create stripes across the planet. Jupiter is famous for its Great Red Spot, which is a huge storm that has been going on for hundreds of years. The planet has many moons, more than ninety, and some of them, like Ganymede, are very big. Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field and many rings, but its rings are small and not as bright as Saturn’s. It spins very quickly, so a day on Jupiter is only about ten hours long, even though the planet is huge. Jupiter is very far from the sun, so it is very cold, but it has been studied a lot by telescopes and spacecraft. Scientists are interested in Jupiter because it helps us understand how planets and the solar system were formed."

    title : "Pluto",
    description : "Why is Pluto no longer a planet? Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union because other objects might cross its orbit.",
    link : "https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/facts/",
    moreInfo : "Pluto is a small object in our solar system. It used to be called a planet, but now scientists call it a “dwarf planet.” Pluto is the farthest from the sun in the solar system. Because it is so far, it is very cold there. Its surface is made of ice and rock, and it has mountains, valleys, and plains. Pluto has a thin atmosphere made mostly of nitrogen, with a little methane and carbon monoxide. The planet has five known moons, and the largest one is called Charon. Pluto moves around the sun in an orbit that is not a perfect circle, so sometimes it is closer to the sun than other times. Its days and years are very long compared to Earth. A day on Pluto is about six and a half Earth days, and one year on Pluto is about 248 Earth years. Scientists are interested in Pluto because it is different from the big planets and can tell us about the outer parts of the solar system. In 2015, a spacecraft called New Horizons visited Pluto and sent back pictures and information about this distant world."
