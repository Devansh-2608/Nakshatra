    title : "Red Giants",
    description: "When a main sequence star less than eight times the Sun’s mass runs out of hydrogen in its core, it starts to collapse because the energy produced by fusion is the only force fighting gravity’s tendency to pull matter together.",
    link : "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant",
    moreInfo : "A **Red Giant** is a type of star that has entered the later stage of its life. When a star like our Sun uses up most of the hydrogen fuel in its core, the core shrinks and heats up, while the outer layers expand and cool, making the star very large and reddish in color. Red Giants are much bigger than the Sun, sometimes hundreds of times wider, but their surface temperature is cooler, which is why they appear red. Inside the core, helium begins to fuse into heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. Red Giants often lose a lot of their outer material through strong stellar winds, which can create beautiful clouds of gas and dust called planetary nebulae. Eventually, depending on the star’s mass, a Red Giant may shrink into a white dwarf, or in the case of more massive stars, explode as a supernova. Studying Red Giants helps astronomers understand the life cycle of stars, how elements are formed, and the evolution of galaxies.A **Red Giant** is a type of star that has entered the later stage of its life.

    title: "White Dwarfs",
    description: "After a red giant has shed its outer layers to form a planetary nebula, it leaves behind a hot, dense core. This stellar remnant, no longer undergoing fusion, cools over billions of years.",
    link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf",
    moreInfo : "A **White Dwarf** is the small, dense remnant left after a star like the Sun has exhausted all its fuel and shed its outer layers. It is no longer undergoing nuclear fusion, so it slowly cools over billions of years. Despite being very small—often similar in size to Earth—a White Dwarf can have a mass comparable to the Sun, making it extremely dense. Its gravity is very strong, and its surface is very hot when it first forms, giving it a bright white or blue-white appearance. Over time, as it radiates away its heat, it gradually becomes dimmer and cooler. White Dwarfs are important for astronomers because they reveal how stars evolve and die, and they can also help measure the age of star clusters by comparing how old the White Dwarfs are. In the far future, a White Dwarf may eventually cool into a cold, dark object called a black dwarf, though the universe is not old enough for any black dwarfs to exist yet.A **White Dwarf** is the small, dense remnant left after a star like the Sun has exhausted all its fuel and shed its outer layers.

    title: "Neutron Stars",
    description: "Formed from the explosive supernova of a massive star, these objects are so dense that a single teaspoon of their material would weigh a billion tons on Earth, composed almost entirely of neutrons.",
    link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star",
    moreInfo :"A **Neutron Star** is the incredibly dense remnant left after a massive star explodes in a supernova. When the core of the star collapses, protons and electrons combine to form neutrons, creating an object that is only about 20 kilometers wide but can have a mass greater than the Sun. Because of this extreme density, a neutron star’s gravity is enormous, and its surface is very hot. Neutron stars can spin very rapidly, sometimes hundreds of times per second, and emit beams of radiation from their magnetic poles; if these beams point toward Earth, we see them as pulsars. Neutron stars are fascinating to scientists because they help us study matter under extreme conditions, test the laws of physics, and understand the life cycles of massive stars.A **Neutron Star** is the incredibly dense remnant left after a massive star explodes in a supernova.

    description: "A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. They often form from the remnants of massive stars.",
    link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole",
    moreInfo : "A **Black Hole** is an object in space with gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. Black holes are usually formed when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life, often after a supernova explosion. The core of the star compresses into a point called a singularity, where the density is infinite, and it is surrounded by an invisible boundary called the event horizon. Anything that crosses the event horizon cannot escape, which is why black holes appear “black.” Despite being invisible, black holes can be detected by observing how they affect nearby stars or gas, pulling material toward them and creating powerful X-ray emissions. Supermassive black holes, millions or billions of times heavier than the Sun, are thought to exist at the centers of most galaxies, including our Milky Way. Studying black holes helps scientists understand extreme gravity, the behavior of space and time, and the evolution of galaxies.A **Black Hole** is an object in space with gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.

    moreInfo : "A **Pulsar** is a type of neutron star that spins very rapidly and emits beams of radiation from its magnetic poles. As the pulsar rotates, these beams sweep across space like a lighthouse, and if one of the beams points toward Earth, we detect regular pulses of light or radio waves.

Scientists study pulsars to learn about extreme states of matter, test the laws of physics, and even measure distances in space.
